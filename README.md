# Hi! I'm Kameron
### I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Oklahoma.
### My GitHub has a few repositories, mostly dealing with methods for processing raw metagenomic sequencing and analyzing the resulting data

### I also upload some fun side projects. My last one is a cost splitting calculator for a group trip with friends -- it helps make sure eveyone is square!
